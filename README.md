# Stack Implementation

This repository contains implementations of a stack data structure using both an array and a linked list in Python. The stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Features

- Array-based stack implementation
- Linked list-based stack implementation
- Basic stack operations:
  - `push(item)`: Add an item to the top of the stack
  - `pop()`: Remove and return the item from the top of the stack
  - `peek()`: Return the top item without removing it
  - `isEmpty()`: Check if the stack is empty
  - `isFull()`: Check if the stack is full
  - `size()`: Return the number of items in the stack
  - `display()`: display the items in the stack
